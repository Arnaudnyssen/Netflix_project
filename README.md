# Netflix_project
In this little project, I'm going to take 3 datasets, "what we watch netflix" in excel, rating from imdb in tsv and titles from imdb in tsv.
I will clean and transform the datasets using pandas, then i will create a database using these 3 three datasets as tables using sqlite3.
Finally I will make visual representations of differents relationships between tables using seaborn and matplotlib.
